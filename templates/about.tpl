        The datasets contained in this website are part of the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) and The CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS).

        CIAT is an agricultural research institution, focused on scientific solutions to hunger in the tropics. CIAT believe eco-efficient agriculture—developing sustainable methods of food production—is the best way to eradicate hunger and improve livelihoods in the region.  CIAT is a leading not-for-profit organization and we have been helping smallholders grow more food and earn more money for 40 years.

        CCAFS is a 10-year research initiative of the CGIAR and the Earth System Science Partnership (ESSP). The CCAFS program seeks to overcome the threats to agriculture and food security in a changing climate, exploring new ways of helping vulnerable rural communities adjust to global changes in climate. CCAFS brings together the world's best researchers in agricultural science, climate science, environmental and social sciences to identify and address the most important interactions, synergies and trade-offs between climate change and agriculture. CCAFS will thus define and implement a uniquely innovative and transformative research program that addresses agriculture in the context of climate variability, climate change and uncertainty about future climate conditions.
